      Mingyu Kim\n\"Planning, programming, data review, QA... Wait, why is there
      so much...?\"\n2D Art, Story: Sohyun Choi\n\"Let me shake a carrot a bit...\"\n\n<color=#5A0B0B>\u25B6
      About Developing 'Moor Rail'</color>\n<size=7>\nDevelopment of Moor Rail began
      in February 2024. Depending on how you look at it, the development time has
      been either long or short. Originally, we aimed to launch Early Access by December
      2024.\nHowever, with the addition of new mission and wave systems, the Early
      Access release had to be postponed.\nThat said, we're confident that the game's
      quality has improved significantly compared to December thanks to these additions
      and upgrades. It\u2019s still a work in progress, but we hope you enjoy Moor
      Rail!\n</size>\n\n<color=#5A0B0B>\u25B6 The Meaning Behind 'Moor Rail'</color>\n<size=7>\nAt
      the start of development, the project was simply called \"Train\" because the
      concept revolved around trains.\nAfter numerous meetings, we finally decided
      on the name Moor Rail.\n\"Moor\" means wasteland, and \"Rail\" refers to railway
      tracks. The name signifies \"starting a journey from a railway track in a barren
      wasteland.\"\n</size>\n\n<color=#5A0B0B>\u25B6 Why Early Access Instead of
      Full Release?</color>\n<size=7>\nThere are still some systems and story elements
      that haven't been implemented yet.\nBy launching in Early Access, we hope to
      gather a wide range of feedback and improve Moor Rail even further before its
      full release.\n</size>\n\n<color=#5A0B0B>\u25B6 What Was the Main Focus During
      Development?</color>\n<size=7>\nWe developed many systems, but we mainly focused
      on trains, difficulty, and UI.\n\nTrains: Each train has its own unique traits.
      Some are helpful, while others are... not so much.\nWe constantly asked ourselves:\n\n\"What
      kind of train would be fun to create?\"\n\n\"Would this train overshadow others?\"\n\n\"How
      can we make trains more interesting?\"\nWe spent a lot of time thinking about
      and refining the trains.\n\nDifficulty:\nEach mission has different difficulty
      levels depending on the monsters you encounter and how many there are.\nThe
      distance you have to travel also changes, so balancing difficulty was crucial.\nSince
      players' experiences can vary greatly depending on their play style, we did
      extensive testing to adjust the balance.\n\nUI:\nEvery time we released a demo
      version, players struggled with the complex UI.\nSome even directly told us
      that the UI was difficult to use.\nThat experience made us realize just how
      important UI is.\nWe've revised the UI 4\u20135 times, each time completely
      reworking it from scratch.\nTo us, a good UI is just as important as the gameplay
      itself.\n\n</size>\n<color=#5A0B0B>\u25B6 What's Next for Moor Rail?</color>\n<size=7>\nMoor
      Rail will continue to evolve!\nWe'll be adding story content, improving visual
      effects, and introducing new systems.\nPlease stay tuned and watch as Moor
      Rail keeps growing step by step!\n</size>"
