      About the development of 'Moor Rail'...</color>\r\n<size=7>\r\nMoore Rail began
      development in February 24.\r\nThe Moore Rail development period is long if
      it is long, and short if it is short.\r\nThe original goal was to set an early
      access launch target in December of 24\r\nWe did, but we delayed the release
      due to insufficient quality.\r\nIt's finally officially released in February
      26th!\r\n\r\nI'm not good enough, but please enjoy Moor Rail!\n</size>\r\n<color=#5A0B0B>\u25B6
      'Moor Rail' Name Meaning</color>\r\n<size=7>\r\nAt the beginning of the development,
      the project was named 'Train'.\r\nBecause the concept is train, we built it
      as 'train'.\r\n\r\nBefore we start the game, we have to go through a lot of
      meetings\r\nIt's been decided as 'Moor Rail'.\r\n'Moore' means wasteland, and
      'rail' is a railroad track.\r\n\r\nIt means, \"I'm starting from a railroad
      in the wilderness.\"\r\nIt's been decided.\r\n</size>\r\n<color=#5A0B0B>\u25B6
      What did you focus on while developing Moor Rail?</color>\r\n<size=7>\r\nOur
      developers have developed a lot of systems,\r\nIt was developed with a focus
      on train, difficulty, and UI.\r\n\r\n1. Trains: Each train has its own characteristics,
      and there's a helpful train,\r\nThere's a train that doesn't help.\r\n\"What
      kind of train should I make?\"\r\n\"Isn't this train buried with another train?\"\r\n\"What
      can I do to make the train fun?\"\r\nI worked on it with so many thoughts and
      concerns.\r\n\r\n2. Difficulty level: The difficulty level varies for each
      mission, and which monster will come out,\r\nIt also depends on which monsters
      will come out and how many.\r\nAnd the travel distance changes, so it's difficult
      to adjust the level of difficulty\r\nI think it's a game.\r\nDepending on how
      the player plays, it can be easy,\r\nIt might be difficult, so we have to go
      through a lot of tests\r\nI worked on it.\r\n\r\n3. UI : Whenever I released
      the demo version, the UI was too complicated.\r\nWhen we watched how the player
      interacted,\r\nIt was difficult for the players.\r\nAnd the player who came
      to us and said that the UI was uncomfortable\r\nIt was here.\r\n\r\nSo we're
      going to show you that games are important, but UI is important\r\nI found
      out.\r\nFor the player's comfortable play, the UI is applied four to five times\r\nI
      changed it.\r\nChanging the UI will give us a lot of thought\r\nThe UI needs
      to be repaired.\r\nThat's how important we are to UI.\r\n</size>"
